1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Probably as a backup if your computer fails or if there are other people working on the project also.
Why might you want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date?
you might not want to work on the latest file or it might change as your working on currently.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks let you take another project and change it without messing up the original but giving credit to the original project. Clones copy projects and dont change the original but dont give credit to the original project. And branches let you add to an existing project to merge later.
